## 1. Introduction

Python, created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, emphasizes code readability and ease of use. Its syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java. Python's popularity has surged across various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, and more.

## 2. Python Basics

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type explicitly. Let's explore basic data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

```python
age = 25
height = 5.9
name = "John Doe"
is_student = True
```

### Control Flow: Conditionals and Loops

Python provides `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for conditionals, along with `for` and `while` loops.

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

### Functions

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword. Here's a simple function that adds two numbers:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 10
```

## 3. Python Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are versatile containers that can hold various data types. They support indexing and slicing.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs, allowing efficient data retrieval.

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}
print(student["age"])  # Output: 20
```

### Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences, commonly used for grouping related data.

```python
coordinates = (4, 7)
```

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

### Classes and Objects

Python supports OOP principles, allowing the creation of classes and objects.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
print(my_car.make)  # Output: Toyota
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance enables a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, battery_capacity):
        super().__init__(make, model)
        self.battery_capacity = battery_capacity
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

```python
def display_info(vehicle):
    print(f"{vehicle.make} {vehicle.model}")
```

## 5. File Handling in Python

### Reading and Writing Text Files

Python provides built-in functions for reading and writing text files.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")
```

### Working with CSV and JSON

Libraries like `csv` and `json` simplify handling CSV and JSON files.

```python
import csv
import json

# Read CSV
with open("data.csv", "r") as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)

# Read JSON
with open("data.json", "r") as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)
    print(data)
```

## 6. Web Development with Flask

### Setting up a Flask App

Flask is a lightweight web framework. To get started, install Flask using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

Create a basic Flask app:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'
```

Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to see the result.

### Handling Routes and Templates

Flask uses routes to map URLs to functions. Templates (using Jinja2) allow dynamic content.

```python
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/profile/<username>')
def profile(username):
    return render_template('profile.html', username=username)
```

### Integrating Forms and File Uploads

Flask-WTF simplifies form handling. Here's an example with file upload:

```python
from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from flask_wtf.file import FileField, FileAllowed

class UploadForm(FlaskForm):
    file = FileField('Upload File', validators=[FileAllowed(['txt'], 'Text Files only!')])
```

## 7. Data Science and Python

### Introduction to NumPy and Pandas

NumPy and Pandas are fundamental libraries for numerical and data analysis in Python.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# NumPy
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(np.mean(array))  # Output: 3.0

# Pandas
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]})
print(df)
```

### Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Matplotlib and Seaborn are popular libraries for creating visualizations.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as

 sns

# Matplotlib
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 25, 30])
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.show()

# Seaborn
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='Salary', data=df)
plt.show()
```

## 8. Testing and Debugging

### Unit Testing with `unittest`

The `unittest` module supports the creation and running of test cases.

```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddition(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(3, 5), 8)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Debugging Techniques

Use the `pdb` module for debugging. Insert the following line where you want to set a breakpoint:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

## 9. Python Best Practices

### PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code

Adhering to PEP 8 enhances code readability. Use tools like `flake8` to enforce PEP 8 standards.

### Virtual Environments

Create isolated environments for each project using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- Windows: `.\myenv\Scripts\activate`
- Linux/macOS: `source myenv/bin/activate`

### Package Management with `pip`

Use `pip` to install and manage packages:

```bash
pip install package_name
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
